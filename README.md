A GUI for controlling and sequencing a JK optical printer with an Arduino.
Requires node and node-webkit.

Currently being developed on a model K45 at the Massachusetts College of Art.

### Development goals

* Successfully integrate with the K45 interface
* Create a traditional-style interface for sequencing the optical printer
* Create a modern interface based on musical sequencers
* Create a scripting language (and console/editor) for generating sequences
